Develop a datastructure for directed, weighted 

3. Implment the Bellman-Ford algorithm. What is the running time for Bellman-Ford using an adjacency matrix representation?

4. Implment Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Your implmentation should produce the shortest weight matrix D(n) and the predecessor matrix PI(n). Limit the number
of newly allocated intermediate result matrices.
